## Introduction

This is a group portfolio website created for three team members: Samuel Aemro, Feven Mesfin, and Wogene Wolde. The website showcases their profiles, skills, featured projects, and contact details. It is designed with a focus on usability, accessibility, and adherence to HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) principles.

The website consists of four main HTML files:
- `index.html`: The landing page that introduces the team.
- `samuel.html`: Samuel's profile page.
- `feven.html`: Feven's profile page.
- `wogene.html`: Wogene's profile page.

---

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- **Interactive Navigation**: Smooth scrolling and dynamic navigation buttons between profiles.
- **Form Submission**: Users can submit ideas via a form on the landing page.
- **Consistent Styling**: Uniform design across all pages using Tailwind CSS.
- **Accessibility**: Includes alt text for images, keyboard navigation, and high-contrast colors.
- **Error Prevention & Recovery**: Form validation ensures users cannot submit incomplete data, and error messages guide corrections.

---

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure of the web pages.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **JavaScript**: Handles interactivity, such as smooth scrolling, form validation, and dynamic navigation.
- **Browser Compatibility**: Tested on modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

## HCI Principles Applied

The website adheres to several core HCI principles:

1. **Learnability**: Clear labels and consistent navigation make it easy for new users to interact effectively.
2. **Consistency**: Uniform layout, color scheme, and interaction patterns across all pages.
3. **Usability**: Simple and intuitive design, including a form submission process with feedback.
4. **Accessibility**: Alt text for images, semantic HTML, and keyboard navigation support.
5. **Affordance**: Buttons and links are styled to suggest their function (e.g., hover effects).
6. **Observability**: Active navigation links highlight the current section or page.
7. **Error Prevention & Recovery**: Form validation prevents submission errors, and undo options can be added in future iterations.
8. **Universal Design**: Equitable use, flexibility in interaction, and low physical effort.
